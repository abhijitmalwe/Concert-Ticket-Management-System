**Endpoint:**  
`POST /api/events`  
Payload: `CreateEventDto`

`PUT /api/events/{id}`

### üé´ Ticket Types (Per Event)

Each event can include multiple ticket types:

## üë§ Customer Flow

---

### üîç View Ticket Availability

Check current ticket availability for a given event and ticket type:  
**GET:** `/api/tickets/availability?eventId={id}`

Returns number of tickets still available (excluding reserved/purchased)

---

### ‚è≥ Reserve Tickets

Customers can reserve tickets temporarily by providing:

- Event ID  
- Ticket Type ID  
- Customer Name  

Reservation is valid for a configured time window (e.g., 10 minutes)

**POST:** `/api/tickets/reserve`  
Payload: `ReserveTicketDto`

---

### üí≥ Purchase Tickets

Purchase a previously reserved ticket using:

- Ticket ID

Marks the ticket as purchased and reduces available count.

**POST:** `/api/tickets/purchase`  
Payload: `PurchaseTicketDto`

---

### ‚ùå Cancel Reservation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not implemented as a separate endpoint yet.

- Reserved tickets can expire if not purchased in time  
- Expired reservations return tickets to availability  
- Handled via `ReservedUntil` logic

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Reservation Logic

When a ticket is reserved:

- It‚Äôs assigned a `ReservedUntil` timestamp (e.g., now + 10 minutes)  
- If that time has passed and the ticket is still unpurchased:  
  - It becomes available again

‚úÖ Prevents overbooking or double-reserving  
‚úÖ Enforced in `TicketService` during availability checks
